      <p class="aboutP">I popped out of my mother on May 3rd,1995 born in New Jersey raised here as well. I wasn't a big fan of school growing up but I loved learning so whenever something has my attention it's 100% concentration. Finally getting into coding was about three months prior when in the middle of the summer my friend was talking to me about how he was taking an off year from school and mentioned bootcamps. I had no idea what coding was when he first mentioned it only that I've played around with html and I didn't even realize it was code until later on. After doing my research it seemed to grab my attention enough to try it out, finishing a couple online courses had taken my interest to the next level wanting to have a cirriculum structured around my education of code. That is how I ended up at Rutgers Coding Bootcamp today. As far as outside of code I bike 3 miles a day to and from work to keep me active, I'll play any sport with a friend. Reading and Art seems to entertaint me more now a days then television/games/movies, to keep up to date with these current events in art/tech I use Medium, Thenextweb, and Hypebeast.  </p>
